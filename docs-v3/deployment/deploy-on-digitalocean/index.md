# Deploy on DigitalOcean

Chartbrew can be deployed on DigitalOcean using the 1-click droplet from the marketplace. This allows you to quickly set up and run Chartbrew with minimal configuration.

Visit the [Chartbrew page on DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/chartbrew), click on "Create Chartbrew Droplet," and follow the on-screen instructions to get started.
